## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate UAV flight in **6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF)**
- Follow a **modular architecture** for flexibility and scalability
- Support **multiple UAV configurations** and future upgrades
- Implement **realistic physics modeling**, including aerodynamics and propulsion
- Enable **plug-and-play** integration of controller algorithms (e.g., PID, waypoint navigation)
- Provide **sensor and environmental models**
- Support **real-time data logging** for analysis and visualization

## üß≠ Purpose

This project provides a structured, high-fidelity simulation platform for UAV system development and testing. It allows verification of flight dynamics, control strategies, and sensor interactions in software‚Äîeliminating early dependency on hardware prototypes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions

- UAV is modeled as a **rigid body**
- Simulation follows **model-based design principles**
- Does not rely on any specific proprietary toolchain

> Originally designed with **ANSYS SCADE** compatibility in mind. Can be extended to support multi-UAV platforms.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system adopts a **modular and decoupled architecture**. Each module is independently upgradable and interacts with others using a **standardized data structure**. This ensures clean separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
