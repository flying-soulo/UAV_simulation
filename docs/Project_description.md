## üéØ Objectives

- Design and implement a software system to simulate UAV flight in **6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF)**
- Follow a **modular architecture** to allow independent development and integration of components
- Support multiple UAV configurations with scalable upgrade options
- Include **realistic physics modeling**, accounting for aerodynamics and propulsion
- Enable **plug-and-play** support for various controller algorithms (e.g., PID, waypoint navigation)
- Include **sensor models** and environmental simulation capabilities
- Enable **real-time data logging** for post-flight analysis and visualization

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions

- UAV is modeled as a **rigid body**
- The simulation will be developed using **model-based design principles**, but without relying on a specific platform

---

## üß≠ Purpose

This simulation aims to support realistic and flexible UAV system testing in a software environment. It is useful for validating flight dynamics, control logic, and sensor behavior without needing physical prototypes early in the development cycle.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The simulation follows a **modular and decoupled structure**, where each module serves a distinct role and can be modified or upgraded independently.

Modules communicate via a **fixed input-output data structure** that allows seamless replacement or upgrading of any module without breaking the system integration.

## üß© Module Breakdown

### 1. **Simulation Module**
- `plant`: Simulated UAV model and response
- `kinematics`: Computes position, velocity, orientation updates
- `dynamics`: Handles force/torque inputs and applies Newton-Euler equations

### 2. **Autopilot Module**
- `autopilot`: High-level mission control and logic
- `waypoint`: Navigation and path following
- `controller`: Interface for control loops
- `PID`: Classical control implementation with tunable gains

### 3. **Data Logging Module**
- `simulation_log`: Stores time-series data during simulation
- `simulation_plot`: Handles plotting or data visualization post-run

### 4. **Visualization Module**
- `virtual`: Interfaces with a virtual environment (2D/3D visual feedback)
- `models`: Defines the visual or simplified geometric representation of UAVs

### 5. **Marh Module**
- `utils`: Utility functions used across all modules (Global helpers, I/O support, transformations, etc.)

## üîÑ Integration Method

All modules interact through a centralized **Simulation and Integration Layer**, which routes and synchronizes data using a **standardized struct** format.

This allows:
- Easy swapping or upgrade of any module (e.g., change the controller type)
- Maintainability and reusability of the architecture
- Simplified debugging and test-driven development

## üìå Summary

This project provides a structured foundation for simulating UAV systems in 6-DOF with a modular, extensible, and controller-agnostic framework. Its focus is on fidelity, configurability, and developer-friendliness, enabling rapid prototyping and iterative development in UAV research and development.
